## Executive Summary

Graphwise represents the strategic merger of two semantic technology pioneers—Ontotext (founded 2008, Sofia, Bulgaria) and Semantic Web Company (founded 2000s, Vienna, Austria)—announced in October 2024. This consolidation created a comprehensive Graph AI powerhouse with approximately 200 employees across North America, Europe, and APAC regions. The combined entity unites Ontotext's GraphDB (a leading RDF-based knowledge graph database) with Semantic Web Company's PoolParty (enterprise semantic metadata and content management platform) to deliver the industry's most complete Graph AI Suite.

Graphwise targets large enterprises struggling with AI hallucinations, siloed data, and untrustworthiness in AI-driven decision-making. Their core value proposition centers on **GraphRAG** (Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation)—a hybrid AI approach that combines deterministic knowledge graphs with probabilistic LLMs to improve accuracy from ~60% (traditional RAG) to over 90% in documented customer deployments. With marquis clients including AstraZeneca, BBC, Ernst & Young, Johnson & Johnson, Roche, Takeda, NASA, Financial Times, and World Bank, Graphwise serves Fortune 500 enterprises across pharmaceuticals, media, financial services, and government sectors.

This intelligence report synthesizes findings from 20+ sources to inform our benchmarking proposal, positioning our team to demonstrate deep technical understanding of RDF-based semantic layer platforms and differentiate our academic research from vendor marketing materials.

## Strategic Insights

### Why This Matters for Our Proposal

**1. Academic Rigor Opportunity**
Graphwise's request for "academic-quality benchmarking paper (similar to data.world study)" signals sophistication. They understand:
- The data.world study methodology (enterprise SQL + knowledge graphs + LLM accuracy)
- The value of independent, peer-reviewed research vs. vendor whitepapers
- The need for apples-to-apples comparisons across heterogeneous platforms (RDF vs. LPG)

**Our Team's Positioning:**
- Demonstrate familiarity with LDBC benchmarks (Atanas Kiryakov is on LDBC board)
- Reference W3C standards rigorously (RDF, SPARQL, OWL 2, SHACL)
- Propose methodology accounting for RDF vs. property graph architectural differences
- Align with their FY2026 planning timeline (flexible, strategic vs. tactical)

**2. Technical Depth Required**
This is not a marketing-driven sponsor. Key technical areas to showcase understanding:

**Semantic Technologies:**
- RDF triple stores vs. labeled property graphs
- SPARQL query optimization and federation
- RDFS++ vs. OWL 2 RL reasoning trade-offs
- SHACL constraint validation
- Named graph management for multi-tenancy

**Benchmarking Challenges:**
- Comparing RDF (Graphwise, Stardog, AllegroGraph, Virtuoso) to LPG (Neo4j) fairly
- AWS Neptune's dual-model evaluation complexity
- Inference/reasoning performance (not applicable to Neo4j)
- GraphRAG-specific KPIs (accuracy, latency, cost per query)
- Data loading vs. query performance vs. reasoning throughput trade-offs

**3. Differentiation from Competitors**
Our proposal must position Graphwise's unique strengths:

**Against RDF Competitors:**
- PoolParty integration = only end-to-end solution (not just database)
- GraphRAG optimization (cost per LLM call, embedding reduction)
- Multi-modal content processing (Gartner IDP recognition)

**Against Neo4j:**
- W3C standards compliance and ontology reuse
- Semantic reasoning capabilities (not available in Cypher/LPG)
- Scientific/regulatory use cases requiring formal semantics

**Against AWS Neptune:**
- Advanced reasoning (OWL 2 RL)
- Multi-cloud/hybrid deployment flexibility
- GraphRAG-specific optimizations (not generic managed service)

**4. Stakeholder Alignment**

**Primary Stakeholders:**
- **Atanas Kiryakov (President, Graphwise; CEO, Ontotext):** Academic background (2,500+ citations), LDBC board member → values rigorous methodology
